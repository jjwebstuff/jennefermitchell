                Group coaching and facilitation is a great way to increase the richness in the team’s diversity through their energy and ideas.  You will benefit from more “aha” moments where individual insights and solutions are highlighted based on other members who have experienced some of the same things.  Jennefer is always amazed at how fast the team learns and grows from each other’s collective wisdom that derives joy from the “journey”.    There is nothing better than group coaching/facilitation where members of the team feel safe to develop both personally and professionally.
